# EidolonOS  
_A self-erasing, RAM-based operating system for invisible computing._  

### What It Does:  
- **Runs entirely in RAM, leaving no disk traces**  
- **Automatically erases logs, caches, and user data upon shutdown**  
- **Uses system signature randomization to avoid detection**  
- **Prevents forensic recovery by never writing to storage**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A machine that erases itself  
Is a machine that cannot be tracked."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Flash **EidolonOS** onto a bootable USB drive  
2. Boot into a full RAM-based environment with no persistent storage  
3. Use the system, knowing that all traces vanish upon shutdown  
4. **Ensure no forensic data is left behindâ€”ever**  

### Warning:  
_"A system that never existed  
Is a system that cannot be recovered."_
